The Gaming Room – Software Design Document Summary Client Overview

The client, The Gaming Room, owns a mobile game called Draw It or Lose It that was originally developed for the Android platform. The company wanted to expand the game to support multiple operating platforms (e.g., web and desktop) using a client-server architecture. Their primary goal was to maintain a secure, efficient, and scalable system that supports multiple game instances, each with unique players and teams, without duplication of names or conflicts in gameplay data.

What I Did Well

I believe I did particularly well in clearly outlining the system architecture and design considerations, including the separation between client and server responsibilities and the use of RESTful APIs for communication. I also provided strong security and scalability justifications, explaining why technologies like Java with Dropwizard were chosen to support modular development and easy future updates.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Process

Working through the software design document before coding helped me deeply understand the system’s structure, requirements, and constraints. Defining the functional and nonfunctional requirements early made it easier to ensure that the prototype met the client’s expectations and that every design choice had a clear purpose.

Potential Revisions

If I could revise one part of the document, I would enhance the UML diagrams and include more detailed relationships between classes and objects. Adding clearer visual representation of interactions (such as updated sequence or class diagrams) would make it easier for developers to implement the design exactly as intended.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on performance, usability, and security. The Gaming Room wanted a reliable multiplayer environment that prevents duplicate entries and provides a seamless experience for users across different platforms. It’s crucial to consider user needs in software design because they directly affect user satisfaction, adoption rate, and long-term system success. Ignoring user requirements often leads to rework and system failures.

Approach to Software Design

I approached the design using object-oriented principles and modular architecture. I began with requirement analysis, followed by UML modeling, component design, and API planning. In future projects, I would continue to use Agile development techniques, iterative design reviews, and CASE tools like Lucidchart or Visual Paradigm to refine diagrams and ensure team collaboration throughout the design phase.

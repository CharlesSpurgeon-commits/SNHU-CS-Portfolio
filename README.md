# SNHU-CS-Portfolio
This repository showcases my academic and technical work completed as part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), with a concentration in Information Security.

The program focuses on developing practical and theoretical skills in software design, object-oriented programming, cybersecurity, and systems analysis. Through a combination of projects, technical documentation, and code implementations, I’ve learned how to analyze problems, design solutions, and implement secure and efficient software systems using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Artifact: Sprint Review and Retrospective
This artifact is the **Sprint Review and Retrospective** from my Agile development project. It demonstrates how I applied Scrum principles, worked across different team roles, and reflected on lessons learned in Agile software development.  

## Portfolio Reflection repository for Computer Science program at SNHU

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?** 
I interpret user needs by breaking down requirements into clear, actionable user stories. User stories put the customer at the center by focusing on the value they expect to receive. Writing user stories with acceptance criteria makes it easier to ensure that the final solution directly meets user expectations. This approach avoids confusion, improves communication with stakeholders, and ensures that development work is always tied to real-world needs.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?** 
I approach developing programs iteratively, focusing on delivering small but meaningful increments of functionality. Using Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, I can prioritize tasks, adapt to change, and continuously improve. In my future work, I plan to incorporate backlog refinement and regular sprint reviews so that I can collaborate effectively with stakeholders and respond to evolving requirements without losing focus.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?** 
Being a good team member means more than just writing code—it means communicating clearly, collaborating openly, and supporting teammates to achieve shared goals. Good team members take ownership of their tasks, share knowledge, and contribute to a culture of trust and accountability. In Agile environments, this also includes embracing feedback, being flexible to change, and ensuring that the team delivers value together rather than working in isolation.

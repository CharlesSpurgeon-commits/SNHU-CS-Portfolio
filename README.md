# SNHU-CS-Portfolio
This repository showcases my academic and technical work completed as part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), with a concentration in Information Security.

The program focuses on developing practical and theoretical skills in software design, object-oriented programming, cybersecurity, and systems analysis. Through a combination of projects, technical documentation, and code implementations, I’ve learned how to analyze problems, design solutions, and implement secure and efficient software systems using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Artifact: Sprint Review and Retrospective
This artifact is the **Sprint Review and Retrospective** from my Agile development project. It demonstrates how I applied Scrum principles, worked across different team roles, and reflected on lessons learned in Agile software development.

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?** 
I interpret user needs by breaking down requirements into clear, actionable user stories. User stories put the customer at the center by focusing on the value they expect to receive. Writing user stories with acceptance criteria makes it easier to ensure that the final solution directly meets user expectations. This approach avoids confusion, improves communication with stakeholders, and ensures that development work is always tied to real-world needs.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?** 
I approach developing programs iteratively, focusing on delivering small but meaningful increments of functionality. Using Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, I can prioritize tasks, adapt to change, and continuously improve. In my future work, I plan to incorporate backlog refinement and regular sprint reviews so that I can collaborate effectively with stakeholders and respond to evolving requirements without losing focus.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?** 
Being a good team member means more than just writing code—it means communicating clearly, collaborating openly, and supporting teammates to achieve shared goals. Good team members take ownership of their tasks, share knowledge, and contribute to a culture of trust and accountability. In Agile environments, this also includes embracing feedback, being flexible to change, and ensuring that the team delivers value together rather than working in isolation.

**The Gaming Room – Software Design Document Summary**
**Client Overview**

The client, The Gaming Room, owns a mobile game called Draw It or Lose It that was originally developed for the Android platform. The company wanted to expand the game to support multiple operating platforms (e.g., web and desktop) using a client-server architecture. Their primary goal was to maintain a secure, efficient, and scalable system that supports multiple game instances, each with unique players and teams, without duplication of names or conflicts in gameplay data.

**What I Did Well**

I believe I did particularly well in clearly outlining the system architecture and design considerations, including the separation between client and server responsibilities and the use of RESTful APIs for communication. I also provided strong security and scalability justifications, explaining why technologies like Java with Dropwizard were chosen to support modular development and easy future updates.

**Helpful Aspects of the Design Process**

Working through the software design document before coding helped me deeply understand the system’s structure, requirements, and constraints. Defining the functional and nonfunctional requirements early made it easier to ensure that the prototype met the client’s expectations and that every design choice had a clear purpose.

**Potential Revisions**

If I could revise one part of the document, I would enhance the UML diagrams and include more detailed relationships between classes and objects. Adding clearer visual representation of interactions (such as updated sequence or class diagrams) would make it easier for developers to implement the design exactly as intended.

**Interpreting and Implementing User Needs**

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on performance, usability, and security. The Gaming Room wanted a reliable multiplayer environment that prevents duplicate entries and provides a seamless experience for users across different platforms. It’s crucial to consider user needs in software design because they directly affect user satisfaction, adoption rate, and long-term system success. Ignoring user requirements often leads to rework and system failures.

**Approach to Software Design**

I approached the design using object-oriented principles and modular architecture. I began with requirement analysis, followed by UML modeling, component design, and API planning. In future projects, I would continue to use Agile development techniques, iterative design reviews, and CASE tools like Lucidchart or Visual Paradigm to refine diagrams and ensure team collaboration throughout the design phase.
